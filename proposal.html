        <h1>My Big Brain 1000000 IQ Idea</h1>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what you should watch but can't ever seem to find anything because there are just too many option? Are you like me and like to binge watch movies and shows? Well since I never have enough things to watch I want to make a website that chooses things for me to watch. I think that I will stick to things on netflix
        because that could make it a bit easier to gather things up. So basically you will enter what type of thing you want to watch and it will bring up suggestions for you.
        I think this would be a really cool idea and achieveable idea. I may change my idea if I find something cooler for me to do but I think that this would be an amazing idea because I literally hate
        having to search for a long time trying to find things on netflix. If it is possible I could get ratings for the content and help narrow down the list. I know that netflix already has categories but some of the things  
        are really trash. I may also change it a bit to add indie movies that are less popular because there are a lot of gems out there. I think it would be fun to do something like this.
        I know there are wesbites like this that already exisit but that is ok :D. I think the biggest problem I would have to overcome would be grouping and sorting through all the suggestions 
        but I really think that this could work and I would have a lot of fun doing this.
