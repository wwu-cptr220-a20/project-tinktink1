        <h1>Figuring Out What To Watch</h1>
        <p>Are you like me and spend an enternity trying to figure what to watch on Netflix? This is the problem I chose to solve when given the project of making a wesbite for my Web development class.
        Below you will find some genres so you can choose what kind of show/movie to watch. If you're feeling extra spicy you can choose random and the website will choose the genre for you. When you click
        on the genre it will take you to another page that has a list of the things to watch in that genre. There is no need to worry also because all of the trash has been taken out of the list for you so all that is avaiable is certified bangers.
        </p>
        <h2>Genres:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Comedy</li>
