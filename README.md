# Course Project

This repository contains practice exercises for the _Web Application Development_ at WWU.
It has been adapted from _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

The site can be viewed at <https://wwu-cptr220-a20.github.io/project-tinktink1/>
This is my project for my Web Dev Class. I decided to go with a website that gives you random quotes from the office. This will hopefully work
with the help of an API that I found online.
