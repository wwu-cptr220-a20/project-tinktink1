        <h1>More Information About the Project</h1>
        <p> I personally love the office and find myself wanting to rewatch it over and over again. I also love to learn quotes from the show because I think  it is super funny.
            This project was for my Web Development class and I brought two things I managed to bring two things I love together. With COVID it has been tough to find motivation 
            but bringing fun into the project gave me the burst I needed to be productive.
